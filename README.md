# Counter Strike 1.6 Chat Reader (VER 0.1 Beta)
Reads and automatically evaluates the equation shown in chat, and writes the answer before anyone else - thus claiming the bonus.

## How It Works:
You must press the toggle key (default 'j') when you see the equation in chat. The machine will then spam the chat so that the equation appears in console, after which it will copy several lines from the console, calculate the result, and write it to chat.

The idea is to spam something in chat (without being kicked) so that the latest message appears in console, and then we can grab it easily by copying the console to clipboard.
This method is much faster, reliable and more useful (we can read the entire history) than the worst case scenario - reading text from an image (only the last few lines).
